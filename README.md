Hi, I’m Hemal—a dual-degree Bioengineering + Business student at UC Berkeley’s Management, Entrepreneurship & Technology Program. Passionate about AI-driven healthcare innovation, product strategy, and market research, I thrive at the intersection of data, technology, and real-world impact.

I’m deeply curious about how emerging technologies can transform patient outcomes, streamline complex systems, and unlock new possibilities in fields from medtech to sustainability. My projects blend analytical rigor, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and a drive to move from insight to implementation—whether that means building prototypes, mapping regulatory pathways, or analyzing market trends.

Some highlights:
- Supported the development and market strategy for DermaScan, an AI-powered wearable medical device and mobile app for skin health analysis, integrating sensor technology, regulatory planning, and user-centered design to enable early detection and personalized care recommendations.
- Led a “Buy Local” campaign in Santa Clara County to boost local business engagement and promote sustainable consumer habits through targeted outreach, branding, and digital strategy.
- Patent Author: Granted 12 design & utility patents (USPTO), including innovations in wearable medical devices for health monitoring, pathogen detection, and environmental sensing. I developed concepts from ideation to filing, collaborating closely with legal teams for robust IP protection.

Technical skills: Python · MATLAB · MySQL · AngularJS · Figma · Canva · Google Workspace · Microsoft Excel, Word, PowerPoint

When I’m not working on a project, you’ll find me diving into the next big innovation trend—or unwinding with photography, cooking/baking, badminton, or travel.

Fun fact: I once learned how to sharpen a pencil at Trader Joe’s.
